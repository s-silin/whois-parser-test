The data in the Blacknight Internet Solutions ("Blacknight") registrar
WHOIS database is provided to you for information purposes only, and may
be used to assist you in obtaining information about or related to a
domain name's registration record.

Blacknight makes this information available "as is" and does not
guarantee its accuracy.

By submitting a WHOIS query, you agree that you will use this data only
for lawful purposes and that, under no circumstances will you use this
data to: (a) allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission by
e-mail, telephone, or facsimile of mass, unsolicited, commercial
advertising or solicitations to entities other than the data recipient's
own existing customers; or (b) enable high volume, automated, electronic
processes that send queries or data to the systems of any Registry
Operator or ICANN-Accredited registrar, except as reasonably necessary
to register domain names or modify existing registrations.

The compilation, repackaging, dissemination or other use of this data is
expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of Blacknight.

Blacknight reserves the right to terminate your access to this WHOIS
database in its sole discretion, including without limitation, for
excessive querying of the WHOIS database or for failure to otherwise
abide by this policy.

Blacknight reserves the right to modify these terms at any time.

By submitting this query, you agree to abide by these terms.

NOTE: THE WHOIS DATABASE IS A CONTACT DATABASE ONLY. LACK OF A DOMAIN
RECORD DOES NOT SIGNIFY DOMAIN AVAILABILITY.
